  consulting work that is performed by Wade Energy covers California state mandated energy building 
  code title-24 energy modeling and documentation, LEED energy modeling, residential energy auditing, 
  and small to medium commercial energy audits in relation to mechanical, envelope and lighting 
  components. One of the major advantages we bring to the table is that our staff all studied Energy,
