  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <div class="desc boxshade">
    <p>Wade Energy started in 2011 with a single LED T8 light bulb that revolutionized the lighting world. Over the last 3 years, we have expanded our business into energy consulting, to truly make a difference in costs and energy reduction.</p>
    <p>Starting with Title-24 energy code compliance in California in 2012, the company worked hard to offer the best service and fastest turnaround times.  As we have been growing, our services and team have as well.  We have members currently pursuing LEED accreditation for building design and construction, and existing buildings operation and maintenance.  We focus primarily on the energy modelling portion of these projects, but have the skills and expertise to also see a project through as project managers of the entire LEED accreditation process.</p>
    <p>In June of 2014 we introduced a third leg to the Wade Energy consulting services, Energy Engineering.  This service is focused on studies, analysis and implementation of energy systems. We have members with a background in clean energy engineering, and passive solar design.  Within the energy engineering field there are additional analyses that we perform that will help our clients achieve a more sustainable future.</p>
