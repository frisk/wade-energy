  <h2>Title 24</h2>
  <div class="desc boxshade">
    <p>Wade Energy specializes in Title-24 energy modeling and documentation for both residential and nonresidential projects.  We like to work with our clients during the initial stages, and final stages of a project.  With the new 2013 Title-24 standards being implemented on January 1st, 2014 the process of achieving building permits will require that the title-24 consultant become involved during the initial design stages, and again at the end to finalize, and complete the energy modeling analysis.</p>
    <p>Wade Energy is a CABEC member (California Association of Building Energy Consultants) with CEPE and CEA associates.  We have been reviewing the new standards and requirements, and are educating ourselves on the new process that will be required by the CEC (California Energy Commission).  Our associates are quick to respond to inquiries and questions from our clients and we are always willing to make revisions and adjustments to meet the needs of your clients.</p>
    <p>As a consulting firm we have the skills and expertise to review and analyze the buildingâ€™s design given its environment, orientation, and envelope design.  Our strong understanding of passive solar design allows our clients a reliable analysis that will benefit their clients.</p>
