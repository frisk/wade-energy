			<p>The LEED energy team includes three consultants skilled in energy modeling. They are proficient in EnergyPro and have additional experience with eQUEST and TRACE. With their modeling software expertise and understanding of building systems they will collaborate with the project team to help clients achieve the most points for their LEED building.</p>
			<p>In addition to LEED services, we also conduct energy audits and develop reports with a set of energy conservation measures specific to you building.</p>
